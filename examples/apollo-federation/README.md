# WunderGraph Apollo Federation

This example demonstrates how to use WunderGraph to manage GraphQL Microservices with Apollo Federation.

WunderGraph can introspect your federated SubGraphs, composes a SuperGraph for you and adds it to your API Dependencies. All of this without any additional dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies and run the complete example in one command:

```shell
npm install && npm start
```

## Test the API

1. (Optional) Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.test` and fill in the required values.
2. Run the following command:

```shell
npm run test
```
