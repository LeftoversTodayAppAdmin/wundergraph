# GraphQL Datasource

The GraphQL DataSource allows you to connect any compatible GraphQL Server.
WunderGraph supports Queries, Mutations as well as Subscriptions.

## Add a GraphQL DataSource

To add a GraphQL data source, edit `wundergraph/wundergraph.config.ts` and introspect the GraphQL server like the config below.

```typescript
import type { WunderGraphConfig } from '@wundergraph/sdk';
import { graphql } from '@wundergraph/sdk/datasources';

const countries = graphql({
	namespace: 'countries',
	url: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/',
});

export default {
	datasources: [countries],
} satisfies WunderGraphConfig;
```

The GraphQL data source is now added to your virtual graph and you can now write operations against it.

```graphql
# Get all countrie names
query {
	countries_countries {
		name
	}
}
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout>
	We recommend always using a namespace, as this will make sure to prevent any naming conflicts in the schema and
	generated types.
</Callout>

## Authenticated GraphQL APIs

If you need to authenticate against your GraphQL API, you can use the `introspection` option to add custom headers to your requests.

```typescript
const github = graphql({
	namespace: 'github',
	url: 'https://api.github.com/graphql',
	introspection: {
		headers(builder) {
			return builder.addStaticHeader('Authorization', `Bearer ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`);
		},
	},
});
```

To forward the Authorization header from the client to the upstream or set static headers, you can use the `headers` option.

```typescript
const github = graphql({
	namespace: 'github',
	url: 'https://api.github.com/graphql',
	headers(builder) {
		return (
			builder
				// We forward `X-Github-Token` to the `Authorization` header.
				.addClientRequestHeader('Authorization', 'X-Github-Token')
				// Add a static header
				.addStaticHeader('X-Github-Next-Global-ID', '1')
		);
	},
});
```

The `X-Github-Token` header will be forwarded from the client to the upstream, while the `X-Github-Next-Global-ID` header will be added to every request.
