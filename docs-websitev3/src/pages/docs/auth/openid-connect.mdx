# OpenID Connect

The `openIDConnect` auth provider is a generic provider that can be used with any OpenID Connect compliant identity provider.

## Configuration

Open your project's `wundergraph.config.ts` and scroll down to the `authentication` object.
Add the `openIDConnect` provider to the `providers` array.

```typescript
import { openIDConnect } from '@wundergraph/sdk/auth';

export default {
  // ...
  authentication: {
    providers: [
      openIDConnect({
        id: 'oidc', // you have to choose this ID
        issuer: new EnvironmentVariable('OIDC_ISSUER'),
        clientId: new EnvironmentVariable('OIDC_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: new EnvironmentVariable('OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET'),
      }),
    ];
  }
}
```

The `openIDConnect` function takes the following arguments:

- `id`: an unique id that identifies the provider, used to reference the provider in the clients
- `issuer`: the issuer provided by your identity provider
- `clientId`: the client ID provided by your identity provider
- `clientSecret`: the client secret provided by your identity provider
