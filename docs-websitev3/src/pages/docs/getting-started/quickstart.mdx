This quick start guide will help you to start a new WunderGraph project from scratch, or add WunderGraph to an existing project.

## Install WunderGraph

### Manual installation

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @wundergraph/sdk
```

### Using `create-wundergraph-app`

```shell
# Init a new project
npx create-wundergraph-app my-project --example simple

# Move to the project directory
cd my-project

# Install dependencies
npm i
```

You can also easily integrate WunderGraph into your existing projects.

```shell
# In your application directory
npx create-wundergraph-app --init
```

## Configure WunderGraph

Your WunderGraph project is configured in the `wundergraph` directory. This is where you can configure your WunderGraph application and write your operations.

Create a `wundergraph.config.ts` file in the `wundergraph` directory and add the following content:

```ts
import type { WunderGraphConfig } from '@wundergraph/sdk';
import { graphql } from '@wundergraph/sdk/datasources';

const countries = graphql({
	namespace: 'countries',
	url: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/',
});

export default {
	datasources: [countries],
} satisfies WunderGraphConfig;
```

Let's dissect what is going on here.

First, we import the `WunderGraphConfig` type from the `@wundergraph/sdk` package. This type is used to validate the configuration.

Next, we import the `graphql` datasource from `@wundergraph/sdk/datasources`. This function is used to create a new GraphQL datasource.

Then we create a new datasource called `countries` and add it to our datasources array. Now the countries GraphQL API will be added to the `Virtual Graph` and it can be used in our operations.

## Write your first operation

Operations are written in the `wundergraph/operations` directory. They can be written in Graphql or TypeScript.

Create your first operation in `wundergraph/operations/Countries.graphql`

```graphql
query Countries($filter: countries_CountryFilterInput) {
	countries_countries(filter: $filter) {
		code
		name
		capital
	}
}
```

## Start the WunderGraph server

Now that we've configured our WunderGraph application and written our first operation, we can start the WunderGraph server.

```shell
npm run wunderctl up
```

WunderGraph will now do some code generation and start the server.
Head over to [http://localhost:9991](http://localhost:9991) and you should see the WunderGraph status page.

Now lets run our query, open the following URL in your browser:
[http://localhost:9991/operations/Countries](http://localhost:9991/operations/Countries)

You'll see a JSON response with a list of countries.
Pretty cool, right? Let's take a look at how this works.

## Modify your operations

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout>
	To add autocomplete support to your GraphQL operations configure `.graphqlrc.yml`. [How to
	guide](/docs/guides/enable-autocompletion-in-your-ide).
</Callout>

The input type and query are prefixed with `countries_` because we're using the `countries` API namespace in the datasource config. This is to avoid naming conflicts when you add multiple APIs to your WunderGraph application.

We'll make a few improvements to the API. First, let's remove the `countries_` prefix from the result, so we can access the result without the `countries_` prefix.

```graphql
query Countries($filter: countries_CountryFilterInput) {
	countries: countries_countries(filter: $filter) {
		code
		name
		capital
	}
}
```

If you run the operation again, you'll see that the result is the same, but the countries can now be accessed without the `countries_` prefix.

Now we can add some extra data to the result. Let's add the `continent` and `currency` fields to the result.

```graphql
query Countries($filter: countries_CountryFilterInput) {
	countries: countries_countries(filter: $filter) {
		code
		name
		capital
		continent {
			name
		}
		currency
	}
}
```

If you run the operation again, you'll see that the result now contains the `continent` and `currency` fields.

Awesome! You now have a basic understanding how WunderGraph works. The next step is to consume the API from your frontend, continue with one of our frontend quickstarts:
